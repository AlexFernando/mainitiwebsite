        'My time at Mai Niti was one of the most profound experiences of my life. I arrived here feeling truly broken. Suffering from a lifetime of depression and trauma, I came here open and willing to try something new, far from the traditions of western medicine, that have always failed to address the route issues I suffered from. From the moment I walked onto the property, I was greeted by total love and support, which was a staple during my time there. You will be surrounded by family, women and children, and glowing smiles. Which for me, put on my fears at ease. Lucile and her father Leonardo are true healers. I’m still baffled by their intuition and ability to hold such a safe and sacred space.',

        'I spent an incredible 2 months at the Mai Niti center. This is the place where you will become healthy and happy. Lucila and Leonardo are true healers who bring their hearts to work. All the time I felt like a part of a big family. Thanks to them and thanks to all the volunteers who took care, interpreted, and prepared the food. I got more than I expected. In the last week, something incredible happened that will stay with me forever. It feels like I no longer need anything external because there is a power within me that can cope with anything. Thank you for showing me this. With love and peace, Maxim',
